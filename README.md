# COMP2396 project
We use Java to implement a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on the localhost. Two client terminals communicate with server using socket. We use Multithreading to handle the request from the client. We also use Swing Components in Java to implement the GUI of this Tic Tac Toe game.
